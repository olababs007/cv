<h3> About My Company</h3>
<p> We are a leading tucking company with a experrience of 5years.We mak sure your good are well delivered with safety.People who know me will describe me to be hardworking .positive , kind, supportive,easy going and full of life.I was born in Pontiac, Michigan on May 4th, 1979.  If you’re wondering, Kit is an old English nickname for Christopher, though I certainly cannot tell you how they came up with it.  It dates back at least to Shakespeare’s time.  In any case, my parents knew of Kit Carson, (whose given name was Christopher) and similarly gave me Christopher as a “more professional” name to fall back on should I find that Kit was insufficient.  To this day, I haven’t.  Further, I usually find Christopher to be a bit cumbersome and only use it for “official” documents.  I did most of my growing up in the Clarkston and Waterford areas of northern Oakland County.  After graduating as salutatorian of my high school class (of nearly 400), I went to Michigan Tech University, where I got my Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical Engineering, with a emphasis in Computer Engineering and an Engineering Enterprise concentration.</p>
